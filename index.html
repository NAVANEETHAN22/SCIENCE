            <h1>Project 1</h1>
            <p>A remote controlled vehicle is any mobile machine controlled by means that is physically not connected with origin external to the machine. There are many types in it, based on the controls – radio control device, Wi-Fi controlled and even Bluetooth controlled. These devices are always controlled by humans and take no action autonomously. The main target in such vehicles would be to safely reach a designated point, maneuver the area and reach back to the point of origin.  In this project we make use of the Bluetooth technology to control our machine car. We don’t call this as a robot as this device doesn’t have any sensors. Thereby, sensor less robots are machines. This machine ccan be controlled by any human using his android mobile phone, by downloading an app and connecting it with the Bluetooth module present inside our car.</p>
